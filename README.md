This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run start
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
## The JSON-server package is used as a temporary BE / DB solution.
## npm install command installs the dependencies of the project as well as the dependencies of the JSON-server.
## npm run start command runs the Project (dev server) and the JSON-server simultaneously.

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.
